How the documentation is organized
==================================

Nvector has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it's organized
will help you know where to look for certain things:

* :doc:`Tutorials </tutorials/index>` take you by the hand through a series of
  typical usecases on how to use it. Start here if you're new to nvector.

* :doc:`Topic guides </topics/index>` discuss key topics and concepts at a
  fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.

* :doc:`Reference guides </reference/index>` contain technical reference for APIs and
  other aspects of nvector's machinery. They describe how it works and how to
  use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

* :doc:`How-to guides </how-to/index>` are recipes. They guide you through the
  steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more
  advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how nvector works.
